# Cruzhacks2018
This was a project that was attempted in order to solve a challenge posed by BigDataFederation.

The Intended purpose of the better difftool was to compare two text documents and identify the minimum sequence
of transformations which can be applied to the first document in order to re-create the second
document.

It should be able to detect transformations, i.e., insertion, deletion, substitution, of blocks of text
(eg. paragraphs, sentences, words).

The contents of this file are public and for the purpose of submission.
Enjoy!
